# Loan-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression
Project idea – 
    The idea behind this ML project is to build a model using Logistic Regression that will classify how much loan the user can take.

    It is based on the user’s marital status, education, number of dependents, and employments. You can build a linear model for this project.
